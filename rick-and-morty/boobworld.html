                <p id = "mainDesc">You pervert…by choosing to travel to this world you were looking forward to a land of boobs… <br>
                     big, small, perky, silicone ones or whatever other boobs you can think of, weren’t you?<br>
                    Well, according to Ricky:<br> 
                    “...truth is, Boob World’s been at the center of a few protests every day for 30 years<br>
                     so they’ve recently rebranded as a boob empowerment experience”

                 <br>
                 Cultural Impact: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ <br>
                 Physical effort: are you a Female or do you have testicles?<br>
                 Comfort Level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (if you are into extreme feminism)<br>

                 The trip Includes: Everything if you are a female.<br>
                 But do you have testicles instead of boobs? Do not worry, we just chopped them off for you
